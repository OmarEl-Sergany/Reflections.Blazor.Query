# Batch 0 lifecycle hardening — status

## Implemented tests

- `Invalidating_an_in_flight_page_request_cancels_it_ignores_its_late_result_and_preserves_layout_state`
- `Invalidating_an_in_flight_page_serialization_cancels_it_and_ignores_its_late_result`

## Test-quality review

- Both tests hold the bridge operation in flight before invalidating its page render state.
- Both tests assert cancellation of the original caller and a fresh second bridge batch after the old operation completes.
- The measurement test also proves layout state remains valid while the page state is invalidated.
- Assertions exercise coordinator completion behavior directly; a cached late value would cause the second request to complete without a second bridge batch and fail the test.

## Validation

- Focused unit suite: 91 passed.
- Full solution: 91 unit tests + 27 component tests passed; build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
